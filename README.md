***📊 Population Change Project***

**📝 Overview**

This project explores population change over time, focusing on births, deaths, and net international migration as key contributors. Using statistical analysis, temporal trends, and causal hypothesis testing, we determine how these factors influence population growth.

**📂 Project Structure**
population.csv – Dataset containing population data, including births, deaths, and net migration figures.
population.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook for analyzing population trends.
county_court.ipynb – (Include description if relevant)

**🔬 Analysis Breakdown**

1️⃣ Statistical Associations
Summary statistics for births, deaths, and migration indicate that natural population growth (births - deaths) plays a major role in population changes.

2️⃣ Temporal Analysis
Visualization of births, deaths, and migration contributions over time shows:
Birth and death rates fluctuated significantly.
Migration displayed a more steady upward trend.
Migration had a significant long-term impact on population change.

3️⃣ Causal Hypothesis
Correlation analysis revealed that births, deaths, and migration all have significant effects on population change, with no single factor being dominant.

**📊 Key Findings**

Births and deaths play the largest role in short-term population shifts.
Migration has a steady influence over time.
All three factors contribute equally to long-term population trends.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Python
Pandas for data manipulation
GeoPandas for spatial analysis
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for clustering
Pingouin for statistical analysis
